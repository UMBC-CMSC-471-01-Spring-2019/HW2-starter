### (1) for the WJ2 problem with jug capacities C1 and C2, what is an upper bound on the number of possible states?

*put your answer here*

### (2) in testoutput1.txt we see that all five algorithms get the same answer, but breadth_first_tree_search and iterative_deepening_search seem to do the most work.  Explain why this is do in a short paragraph.

### (3) Describe your heuristic, why it might help, and give an argument about why it is admissible.

### (4) use your program to show that for a a WJ2 problem with a 9 liter jug and a 4 liter jug that are both initially empty, it is possible to reach a goal state where the first jug has N liters for N in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. we don't care what the second jug has in it.  For each of the ten cases, you need only show the path that print_solution displays.
